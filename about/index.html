<h2>General gumpff</h2>


				<p>I'm a professional statistician - or possibly a data scientist - based in New Zealand, with a background running analytics/stats/data science teams up to 20 people in size, currently available as a private contractor/consultant.  Most of my career has been in management and evaluation of overseas aid programmes, but since 2011 I have been working on a range of economic data issues, mostly in New Zealand.</p>

</a>
				
            <p>My interests include economics, econometrics, complex surveys, time series, spatial statistics, text mining, R, data visualisation, and anything that involves putting data and analysis in the hands of as broad a range of people as possible.</p>
            
            
            <p>The views expressed in this blog are very definitely my own, not my organisation or the New Zealand government.  I might be blogging about data and analysis issues that crop up in work, but anything controversial that relates to my work has crept in by mistake and will be removed if and when I notice it.</p>

<h2>R packages</h2>
<div>I am the author and maintainer of the following R packages:
<ul><li><a href = "https://github.com/ellisp/ggseas">ggseas package</a> which allows you to easily incorporate seasonal adjustment and seasonal decomposition into an exploratory data analysis workflow based around ggplot2. 
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/ggseas"><img src = "http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ggseas"></a>
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/ggseas"><img src = "http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/ggseas"></a></li>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/ellisp/Tcomp-r-package">Tcomp package</a> which provides data from the 2010 Tourism Forecasting Competition described in <a href = http://robjhyndman.com/papers/forecompijf.pdf>Athanasopoulos et al</a>. 
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/Tcomp"><img src = "http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/Tcomp"></a>
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/Tcomp"><img src = "http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/Tcomp"></a></li>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect">nzelect package</a> which provides conveniently tidied up election results for New Zealand; so far limited to aggregate results from the 2014 general election.
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/nzelect"><img src = "http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/nzelect"></a>
<a href = "http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/nzelect"><img src = "http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/nzelect"></a></li>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect">nzcensus package</a> which provides a range of calculated demographic variables at meshblock, area unit, territorial authority, and regional council level from the New Zealand census.   This package was originally part of the nzelect project but can now be installed and used separately.  The source is the Statistics New Zealand census meshblock data.  The package is too large to publish on CRAN so is only available from GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>
I also host on my GitHub page the <a href = "https://github.com/ellisp/forecastHybrid">forecastHybrid package</a>, which makes it easy to estimate ensemble or hybrid forecasts using a range of the methods in Rob Hyndman's forecast package.  I'm a contributor to that package but David Shaub is the primary author and maintainer.
